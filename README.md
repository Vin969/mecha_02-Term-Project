## Software Design

When the program is run on the STM32L476RG, three tasks (`turret_driver.py`, `thermal_camera.py`, and 
`actuator_flywheel.py`) are run cooperatively using a scheduler. Each task controls a specific electrical/mechanical
hardware component (Turret motor, Thermal Camera, and Linear Actuator) at different priorities and frequencies. These 
tasks also share data to run certain functions. All of this is done during the 10-second window of the duel. For a more 
detailed explanation regarding the Software Design, please refer to the [Github Pages](https://dijonm53.github.io/mecha_02-Term-Project/)
