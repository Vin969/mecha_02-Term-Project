What should system do:

- Each of these components are divided up by the tasks in the scheduler. For example, the System, Linear Actuator/Flywheel, and Sensor are all separate tasks (3 total).
- Because the flywheel and linear actuator are relatively simple, they can be combined into one task.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start:
	System:
		- Turn 180 Degrees
	Linear Actuator/Flywheel:
		Linear Actuator:
			- Idle
		Flywheel:
			- Off
	Sensor:
		- Idle
		
During 5 seconds:
	System:
		- Idle
	Linear Actuator/Flywheel:
		Linear Actuator:
			- Push bullet as far as it can without touching flywheel
		Flywheel:
			- Off
	Sensor:
		- Initialized
		- Getting data
		
Right Before Turning:
	System:
		- Convert degree to meaningful setpoint
	Linear Actuator/Flywheel:
		Linear Actuator:
			- Idle
		Flywheel:
			- Turned on, to rev it up before shooting
	Sensor:
		- Send data (float) to system
		
After finish turning:
	System:
		- Stop Turning
		- Send indication to linear actuator to begin shooting (boolean)
	Linear Actuator/Flywheel:
		Linear Actuator:
			- Wait for signal from system
			- extend fully once recived signal
		Flywheel:
			- Turned on (from before)
	Sensor:
		- Idle
